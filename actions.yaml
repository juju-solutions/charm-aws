purge-all-iam-entities:
  description: |
    Purge all IAM entities created by this charm, such as roles,
    instance-profiles, and policies.

    Be careful!  This includes entities created in other models,
    and even roles and instance-profiles that are in active use.
    This can break applications depending on their permissions!
